# simIris
Simulation tool for the IRIS experiment @ TRIUMF


## Download and Installation ##
	
simIris requires ROOT (https://root.cern.ch).

Make required changes into Makefile for MacOS 

To install simIris use

	git clone https://github.com/iris-triumf/simIris
	cd simIris
	make

## testing the simIris ##
The test folder contains the example of reaction file and geometry file for 12C(d,d)12C reaction channel @12 AMeV. 
In main simiris directory type 
	./simulate

it will generate root file for 12C(d,d)12C in test folder

## Running simIris ##

From the main simIris folder, you can run simIris with
 
	./bin/simIris --output=/path/to/to/your/output.file --reaction=/path/to/your/reaction.file --geo=/path/to/your/geometry.file --dedx_dir=/path/to/folder/containing/energy_loss_tables --events=number of events to be simulated [--run=run number]

Configuration files for the reaction and the geometry as well as energy loss tables have to be provided, the output file will be a root file which can be further analysed using physIris.


## The Geometry File ##

The geometry file contains a set of parameters describing the experimental setup of IRIS to be used in the simulation. The following parameters are available:
	
	Bs: Size of beam spot in mm (usually ~2mm)			
	ICPressure: Gas pressure of ionization chamber in Torr (usually 19.5 Torr or lower)
	FOIL: Material of the foil (Ag for all experiments using the H2 or D2 target)			
	TFoil: Thickness of the foil in mg/cm2 (4.816 for current Ag foil)
	AoZFoil: Mass to charge ration of foil (2.3 for Ag foil)
	TARGET: Target material (H or D)		
	TTgt: Target thickness in mg/cm2
	TSD[1-2],TSU,TYY[1-8],TYU[1-8]: Detector thicknesses in um for S3-1, S3-2, upstream S3, and 8 YY1 array segments for the downstream and the upstream array
	DSD,DSU,DYY,DYU: Detector distances from target in mm for S3-1, upstream S3, downstream and upstream YY1 arrays. S3-2 is at a fixed distance to S3-1. Convention: Distances for the upstream detectors have to be negative	
	MASK: Use the target mask? (1=yes, 0=no)
	SHIELD: Use the heat shield? (1=yes, 0=no)
	ORIENTATION: Orientation of the target system (0=foil upstream of target, 1=foil downstream of target)


## The Reaction Parameter File ##

The reaction parameter file contains information about the reaction to be simulated. The following parameters are available:

	N: number of particles in outgoing channel, Reactions with up to 6 particles are supported by simIris
	A,a,B,b,c,d,e,f: Define the particles involved in the reaction: A(a,b)B[+c+d+e+f] 
	R1,W1: Excitation energy and resonance widht of beam-like ejectile in MeV
	R2,W2: Excitation energy and resonance widht of target-like ejectile in MeV
	E: Beam energy in MeV
	SHT: Reaction on the solid H2/D2 target? (1=yes, 0=no)

Each parameter in both the geometry and the reaction parameter file has to be separated from the value by an "="-sign without any spaces, e.g. ICPressure=19.5

## Energy loss tables ##

simIris uses SRIM  energy loss tables to calculate the energy loss of particles going through detector materials or the target. Tables in a usable format can be created using LISE++.

## CATIMA ##

simIris supports using [catima](https://github.com/hrosiak/catima) for generating energy loss table automatically based on the geometry and reaction input files. If you want to use this functionality, install catima an your system then compile using the following flags

	make USE_CATIMA=1 CATIMAPATH=[path to catima]

To run a simulation using catima, omit the --dedx_files when running simiris and it will default to generating tables from catima.

## Output files

The output root file of simIris contains a tree with the following objects:

	yd, yu, sd1, sd2, su, csi: Containers for detector hits. They contain the detector thickness, and information about the simulated detector hit: multiplicity, X-, Y-, Z-position, angls, git segments, and depostited energy.

	tlP, blP: Contain information about the generated particle tracks. Contains angles T(heta) and P(hi) and energies in the lab and center-of-mass system. Also saves the energy loss in the silver foil and target as well as the resulting energy behind the target (FoildE, TrgtdE, Ebt).

	tlPdec1/2, blPdec1/2: Same as blP and tlP, but only used when the heavy particle at the simulated excitation energy is unbound.

	det: Contains the same information as yd, yu, etc. but in the same format as data sorted with treeIris. Simulated data from simIris can therefore analysed using physIris (https://github.com/iris-triumf/physIris) the same way as real experimental data.


Have fun!!!
